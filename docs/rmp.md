Reusable Machine Pattern?
=========================

What is this? A mini-manifesto?

An RMP -- A Reusable Machine Pattern -- is a missing pattern in software design. This includes core machinery, design documentation, and built-in diagnostic examples.

As a machine, it is built upon the following notions:

1. The core components should be based on tangible concepts.
2. It should be easy to reason about and experiment with.
3. It should be self-standing, but allow for trivial addition of plugins.
4. A plugin-in or extension scheme must be provided with examples and documentation.

While we  may have many examples of software that follow these basic points, we need to be more specific about what qualifies something as an RMP...

__Immediately Runnable__ examples are a core requirement for an RMP. An RMP is not a framework or library. It may include elements of those, but these are merely extension points and conveniences. The essence of an RMP is that it is self-standing, even if this, as such, that it doesn't do anything interesting.

__Built-in diagnostics__ plugins are useful for RMPs. They allow users to interact immediately, gaining tangible insight into how the thing works. This experience is vital to building a successful RMP.

__Documentation__ that explains how the specific machine pattern works is necessary. By getting a grasp on the built-in conceptual handles while they experiment with the machine, users can develop a kinetic understanding. This accelerates their ability to build application-specific behavior to plug-in to the machine.

There are other aspects of RMPs that will find their way to this document in time.. It is a work in progress.
