     * block according to the time to block for and some knowledge of how much
     * overhead and accuracy each method of blocking has. It's not perfect, but it
     * is marginally better than a CPU burning busy wait or a throughput killing sleep
     * right in the middle of every single thread.
     *
     * A better implementation would use sparse sampling of effective accuracy
     * and feedback into the offsets, to deal with variability in CPU availability.
