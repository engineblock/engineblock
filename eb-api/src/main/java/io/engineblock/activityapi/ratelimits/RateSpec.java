/**
 * <H2>Rate Limiter Specifications</H2>
 *
 * <P>A rate spec represent the configuration of a rate limiter. It is the event carrier
 * for applying changes to a rate limiter. For scripting purposes, rate limiters can be
 * controlled via assignment of a configuration string. A future version of the scripting
 * API will support direct method access. For now, the following semantics will apply
 * to the configuration value assigned to any of the rate parameters like cyclerate and striderate.
 * </P>
 *
 * <H2>Controlling Rate Limiters</H2>
 *
 * Rate limiters specifiers can be easily constructed programmatically. However, in scripting,
 * these will often be controlled by assigning a configuration string.
 *
 * <P>
 * When a rate limiter is configured
 * using the configuration String, it can be in one of the following forms:
 *
 * <UL>
 * <LI>&lt;rate&gt;</LI>
 * <LI>&lt;rate&gt;,&lt;burst ratio&gt;</LI>
 * <LI>&lt;rate&gt;,&lt;burst ratio&gt;,&lt;verb&gt;</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * Where:
 *
 * <EM>rate</EM> is the ops per second, expressed as any positive floating point value.
 * <EM>burst ratio</EM> is a floating point value greater than 1.0 which determines how much faster
 * the rate limiter may go to catch up to the overall.
 * <EM>verb</EM> is one of configure, start, or restart, as explained below.
 *
 * For example:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>200 - allow up to 200 ops to start per second, with the default burst ratio of 1.1.
 * Start the rate limiter automatically.</LI>
 * <LI>3.6,2 - Allow up to 3.6 ops to start per second, but allow up to 7.2 ops per second
 * if needed to catch up. Start the rate limiter automatically </LI>
 * <LI>1000,1.05,restart - Allow up to 1000 ops per second on average, but allow 1050 ops per second
 * if the workload gets behind. If the rate limiter was already running, restart it, clearing any
 * previous backlog (wait time) and resource pools.</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * <H2>Rate Limiter Life Cycle</H2>
 *
 * <P>A rate limiter can be directly <EM>configured, started, restarted</EM>. Indirectly, rate
 * limiter construction and initialization occurs as needed.</p>
 *
 * <DL>
 *
 * <DT>(constructed)</DT>
 * <DD>Rate limiters are constructed and assigned automatically when they are first configured. A rate
 * limiter may not be explicitly constructed by the user.</DD>
 *
 * <DT>configure</DT>
 * <DD>When a rate limiter is configured, the rate spec is applied to it. If the rate limiters is
 * already running, then this new rate is applied to it. Applying the same rate parameters a
 * second time to a given rate limiter is a no-op.</DD>
 *
 * <DT>(initialization)</DT>
 * <DD>A rate limiter is initialized immediately before it is initially started. Rate limiters are also
 * re-initialized when they are restarted. When a rate limiter is initialized, the start time is set
 * to the current time, and the resource pools and accumulated wait time are zeroed. A rate limiter may
 * not be explicitly initialized by the user.
 * </DD>
 *
 * <DT>start</DT>
 * <DD>Starting a rate limiter activates the rate metering logic according to the current time. From
 * the time a rate limiter is started, any unused time will accumulate as wait time. A rate limiter is required
 * to be reset immediately before it is started for the first time.</DD>
 *
 * <DT>restart</DT>
 * <DD>Restarting a rate limiter is the same as starting it initially. The only difference is that
 * restarting forces a re-initialization as part of the configuration.</DD>
 *
